# Physics-Informed Machine Learning with Generalized Bathtub Model

## Introduction

* Estimating the traffic states by using a machine learning model without explicit theoretical assumptions.
* Implementing the bathtub model to the real road network for estimating traffic states without costly high data (OD pattern data).
* Using mobile data for estimating traffic states with relatively little data than loop detector data.
